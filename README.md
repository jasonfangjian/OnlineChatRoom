there are two uml diagrams : one shows main classes and abstract classes and Interfaces in the image and their relationship, the other one shows details in package format. please note due to having a lot of classes, the complete uml ( all classes and interfaces) wouldn't fit the screen and intllij couldn't save it.

```
In the backend, org.json is imported to parse/create JSON object.

If you cannot import org.json, you should:
1. Download json-20200518.jar (I have uploaded this file to googleDrive)
2. In intelliJ, click on "File" => "Project Structure" => "Libraries" => "+" => choose json-20200518.jar => Apply.
```
